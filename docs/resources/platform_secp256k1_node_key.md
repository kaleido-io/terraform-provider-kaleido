# kaleido_platform_secp256k1_node_key (Resource)

A secp256k1 node key is a key pair used by a blockchain node (typically Ethereum) to authenticate to peers, sign messages,
		 and validate blocks. Similar to a TLS certificate. This resource generates a new key pair each time it is created and stores it securely in the state.
		 For secp256k1 keys used for transaction signing, see the 'kaleido_platform_kms_key' resource within our Key Management Service (KMS).

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Generates a SECP256K1 key pair for a Besu node to use for P2P and block proposals
resource "kaleido_platform_secp256k1_node_key" "secp256k1_node_key" {}

// Provide the private key securely to the Besu node in the config_json via a cred set
resource "kaleido_platform_service" "besu_node" {
  type        = "BesuNode"
  name        = "a-besu-node"
  environment = "e:1234abcd"
  runtime     = "r:1234abcd"
  config_json = jsonencode({
    network = {
      id = "n:1234abcd"
    }
    nodeKey = {
      credSetRef = "nodeKey"
    }
    signer = true // Node will ask the network to vote it in as a validator
  })
  cred_sets = {
    nodeKey = {
      type = "key"
      key = {
        value = kaleido_platform_secp256k1_node_key.secp256k1_node_key.private_key
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Read-Only

- `address` (String) The (public) address of the key pair, used for validator identities in Ethereum and BFT consensus.
- `private_key` (String, Sensitive) The private key of the key pair, can be uploaded to a blockchain node service's config when creating nodes.
- `public_key` (String) The public key of the key pair, also node as enode ID in Ethereum.
